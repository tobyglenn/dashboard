**Status:** Review  
**Assignee:** Clarity  
**Epic:** NutriTrack BJJ Buddy

## Description

Profile screen must display user data (name, age, weight, height, goals) and Onboarding must save that data persistently.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/nutritrack/src/screens/Profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`
2. Read `nutrition-app/nutritrack/src/screens/Onboarding/OnboardingScreen.tsx`
3. Verify Onboarding saves to the correct store/AsyncStorage key
4. Verify Profile reads from that same key and displays correctly
5. Fix any missing persistence or display issues

## Success Criteria
- Onboarding: user can enter name, age, weight, height, calorie goal
- Profile: shows saved data and allows editing
- Data persists on refresh
