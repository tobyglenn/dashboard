## Description

NutritionSummary must display a detailed breakdown of daily nutrition: calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, and micronutrients if available, compared against the user's goals.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/nutritrack/src/screens/NutritionSummary/NutritionSummaryScreen.tsx`
2. Verify it reads today's entries from nutritionStore and aggregates totals
3. Verify it reads user goals from profile store
4. Render progress bars or totals for each macro
5. Fix any aggregation errors or missing data

## Success Criteria
- Shows total calories consumed vs goal
- Shows protein/carbs/fat consumed vs goal
- Progress indicators are accurate
