**Status:** Review

**Epic:** NutriTrack BJJ Buddy

## Description

The Diary screen must show food entries grouped by meal (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks) with calorie/macro totals, and allow individual entry deletion.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/nutritrack/src/screens/Diary/DiaryScreen.tsx`
2. Verify it reads from `nutritionStore` (entries for the selected date)
3. Confirm entries are grouped by `meal` field and rendered in sections
4. Verify delete calls `nutritionStore.removeEntry(id)` and re-renders
5. Confirm daily totals update after deletion

## Success Criteria
- Entries appear grouped by meal type
- Each entry shows food name, quantity, and calories
- Delete button removes entry and updates totals
