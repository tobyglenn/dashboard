# nt-003: Fix BarcodeScanner for Web Platform

**Status:** Review  
**Assignee:** Clarity  
**Epic:** NutriTrack BJJ Buddy

## Description

`expo-barcode-scanner` requires native camera APIs unavailable on web, causing a blank/crashed screen. The scanner must gracefully degrade on web with a manual UPC input fallback.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/nutritrack/src/screens/BarcodeScanner/BarcodeScannerScreen.tsx`
2. Add platform check: `import { Platform } from 'react-native'`
3. On `Platform.OS === 'web'`: render a text input for manual barcode entry instead of camera
4. On native: keep the existing scanner
5. Both paths should call the Open Food Facts barcode lookup on submit

## Success Criteria
- Web: shows text input field for barcode, looks reasonable
- Native: scanner works as before
- No crash on web
