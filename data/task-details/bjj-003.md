# bjj-003: Verify AsyncStorage Persistence in techniqueStore

**Status:** Review  
**Assignee:** Clarity  
**Epic:** NutriTrack BJJ Buddy

## Current State

`techniqueStore.ts` already uses `persist` middleware with `AsyncStorage` (lines 3-4, 25, 158). No raw `localStorage` calls. The infrastructure is correct.

## Task

Verify favorites and progress actually persist, and that there are no residual `localStorage` calls elsewhere in the codebase.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/bjj-buddy/src/store/techniqueStore.ts`
2. Confirm no `localStorage` calls remain anywhere in the file
3. Run: `grep -r "localStorage" nutrition-app/bjj-buddy/src/` — should return nothing
4. Test: mark a technique as favorite, refresh, confirm it persists
5. Fix anything that doesn't work

## Success Criteria
- Zero localStorage calls in the codebase
- Favorites persist across refresh
- No TypeScript errors
