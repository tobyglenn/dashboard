# bjj-007: Fix Home Screen and Profile for BJJ Buddy

**Status:** Review  
**Assignee:** Clarity  
**Epic:** NutriTrack BJJ Buddy

## Description

BJJ Buddy Home screen must show a training summary (sessions this week, streak, next milestone) and the Profile screen must show/edit user's belt level, gym, and training goals.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/bjj-buddy/src/screens/Home/HomeScreen.tsx`
2. Verify it reads from bjjStore for session count, streak, next milestone
3. Read `nutrition-app/bjj-buddy/src/screens/Profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`
4. Verify belt level, gym name, and training frequency are editable and persist
5. Fix any missing store reads or broken renders

## Success Criteria
- Home shows weekly session count and current streak
- Profile shows and edits belt/gym/goals
- Both screens load without crash
