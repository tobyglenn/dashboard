## Description

RecipeBuilder must allow users to create custom recipes by combining food items, with aggregated nutrition calculated automatically.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/nutritrack/src/screens/RecipeBuilder/RecipeBuilderScreen.tsx`
2. Verify ingredient search works (calls Open Food Facts or local store)
3. Verify adding an ingredient appends it to recipe list and recalculates totals
4. Verify save creates a recipe entry in the appropriate store
5. Fix any broken calls or missing store actions

## Success Criteria
- Can search and add multiple ingredients
- Nutrition totals update with each addition
- Can save recipe and see it available when logging food
