# bjj-006: Fix TechniqueLibrary Search and Favorites

**Status:** Review  
**Assignee:** Clarity  
**Epic:** NutriTrack BJJ Buddy

## Description

TechniqueLibrary must allow browsing BJJ techniques by category, searching by name, marking favorites, and viewing detail pages.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/bjj-buddy/src/screens/TechniqueLibrary/TechniqueLibraryScreen.tsx`
2. Verify technique data loads (from static JSON or store)
3. Verify search filters techniques by name in real-time
4. Verify favorite toggle calls `techniqueStore.toggleFavorite(id)` and persists
5. Verify tapping a technique navigates to detail view with full info

## Success Criteria
- Browse all techniques by category
- Search works
- Favorites persist
- Detail view shows technique name, description, video link (if any)
