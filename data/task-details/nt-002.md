# nt-002: Fix FoodSearch to Properly Add Foods to Diary

**Status:** Review  
**Assignee:** Clarity  
**Epic:** NutriTrack BJJ Buddy

## Description

The full flow `Home → FoodSearch → search → tap result → AddFood → save → Diary` must work end-to-end. Currently the flow may be broken at the navigation or store level.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/nutritrack/src/screens/FoodSearch/FoodSearchScreen.tsx`
2. Read `nutrition-app/nutritrack/src/screens/AddFood/AddFoodScreen.tsx`
3. Verify navigation params pass correctly: FoodSearch → AddFood (food item data)
4. Verify AddFood calls `nutritionStore.addEntry()` with correct structure
5. Verify Diary screen reads from the same store slice
6. Fix any broken navigation, missing params, or store calls

## Success Criteria
- User can search for a food, tap it, set quantity, save, and see it in the Diary
- Entry shows correct name, calories, and macros
