# bjj-002: Verify AsyncStorage Persistence in bjjStore

**Status:** Review  
**Assignee:** Clarity  
**Epic:** NutriTrack BJJ Buddy

## Current State

`bjjStore.ts` already has `persist` middleware with `AsyncStorage` (lines 3-4, 122, 189-190). The infrastructure is in place with storage key `bjj-buddy-storage`.

## Task

Verify it actually works — confirm sessions, stats, and belt history all persist correctly.

## Steps

1. Read `nutrition-app/bjj-buddy/src/store/bjjStore.ts` lines 120-195
2. Confirm `partialize` (if present) includes all needed fields: `sessions`, `stats`, `currentBelt`
3. Run the app and log a BJJ session
4. Hard-refresh and confirm session still appears
5. If anything doesn't persist, check what fields `partialize` excludes

## Success Criteria
- Training sessions persist across refresh
- Belt history persists
- Stats (streak, totals) persist
